  There might be circles on the graph, which means the same node could be
  enqueued twice, which need HashMap here.

# 2. BFS in Graph

## n nodes and m edges

* Undirected Graph\(complete: every vertex is connected with every other vertex\): m = n\(n - 1\) / 2
* Directed Graph: m = n\(n - 1\)
* Time complexity: O\(n + m\)
